              During my time in Dubai, I experienced severe hair fall. Back in India, after trying many products with no success, I turned to Unani and Tibbi medicine. With the help of my friend Abdul Qadir Miyan, we created Tibb Hair Oilâ€”a natural solution that delivered amazing results. Now, we're sharing it with others, rooted in ancient wisdom for effective, natural hair care.
